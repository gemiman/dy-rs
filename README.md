## Why dy-rs?

Building web APIs in Rust shouldn't require wiring together 10+ crates and writing hundreds of lines of boilerplate. **dy-rs** gives you the productivity of FastAPI and Spring Boot, with Rust's performance and type safety.

### ⚡ Features

- 🎯 **Zero Config** - Database, migrations, CORS, logging work out of the box
- 🔒 **Type-Safe** - Compile-time guarantees for routes, validation, and serialization
- 📚 **Auto-Generated Docs** - Swagger UI and OpenAPI specs from your code
- ✅ **Built-in Validation** - Request validation with helpful error messages
- 🔥 **Hot Reload** - Fast development cycle with `dy dev`
- 🎨 **Opinionated Structure** - Convention over configuration
- 🚀 **Production Ready** - Structured logging, error handling, health checks

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cargo install dy-rs-cli
```

**Note:** By default, dy-rs includes Swagger UI for API documentation. If you encounter installation issues, you can install without it:

```bash
cargo add dy-rs --no-default-features
```

To enable Swagger UI later:

```bash
cargo add dy-rs --features swagger-ui
```

### Create Your First API

```bash
# Create a new project
dy new myapi

# Run it
cd myapi
cargo run
```

Your API is now running at:
- 🌐 **http://localhost:8080** - API endpoints
- 📚 **http://localhost:8080/docs** - Swagger UI
- 💚 **http://localhost:8080/health** - Health check

### Your First Endpoint

```rust
use dy_rs::prelude::*;

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct User {
    id: Uuid,
    name: String,
    email: String,
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Validate)]
struct CreateUser {
    #[validate(length(min = 2))]
    name: String,
    
    #[validate(email)]
    email: String,
}

async fn create_user(
    ValidatedJson(payload): ValidatedJson<CreateUser>
) -> ApiResult<User> {
    let user = User {
        id: Uuid::new_v4(),
        name: payload.name,
        email: payload.email,
    };
    Ok(Json(user))
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    App::new()
        .auto_configure()
        .route("/users", post(create_user))
        .run()
        .await
        .unwrap();
}
```

That's it! You get:
- ✅ Automatic request validation
- ✅ Type-safe JSON serialization
- ✅ Structured error responses
- ✅ OpenAPI documentation
- ✅ Request tracing and logging

## What's Included?

### 🎁 Out of the Box

- **Configuration Management** - TOML files + environment variables
- **Database Integration** - PostgreSQL with connection pooling (SQLx)
- **Request Validation** - Derive-based validation with helpful errors
- **Error Handling** - Centralized error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- **CORS** - Sensible defaults, fully configurable
- **Logging & Tracing** - Structured logging with request correlation
- **Health Checks** - `/health` endpoint for orchestration
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** - Auto-generated docs at `/docs` (with `swagger-ui` feature, enabled by default)

### 📚 Swagger UI Configuration

**Enabled by default** - Swagger UI is included with the default features:

```toml
[dependencies]
dy-rs = "0.1"  # Includes Swagger UI
```

**Disable if needed** (smaller binary, faster compile):

```toml
[dependencies]
dy-rs = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }
```

**Re-enable later**:

```toml
[dependencies]
dy-rs = { version = "0.1", features = ["swagger-ui"] }
```

### 📦 CLI Tool

```bash
# Create new project with template
dy new myapi --template rest-api

# Run with hot reload
dy dev

# Coming soon:
# dy generate resource User
# dy db migrate
```

## Configuration

Configuration is loaded from multiple sources (in order of priority):

1. `config/default.toml` - Base configuration
2. `config/local.toml` - Local overrides (gitignored)
3. Environment variables - Prefixed with `APP__`

```toml
# config/default.toml
[server]
host = "0.0.0.0"
port = 3000

[database]
url = "postgres://localhost/mydb"
max_connections = 10
```

Override with environment variables:
```bash
APP__SERVER__PORT=8080 cargo run
```

## Examples

git clone https://github.com/gemiman/dy-rs
cd dy-rs
cargo build
cargo test

# Run the example
cd examples/rest-api
cargo run
```

## Philosophy

**dy-rs** is built on these principles:

1. **Convention over Configuration** - Sensible defaults, minimal boilerplate
2. **Type Safety First** - Leverage Rust's type system to catch errors at compile time
3. **Developer Experience** - Make the common case easy, the hard case possible
4. **Production Ready** - Include observability, error handling, and best practices by default
5. **Composable** - Built on Axum, use Axum patterns when you need them

## Why Not Just Use Axum?

**Axum** is fantastic - it's the foundation of dy-rs! But Axum is intentionally minimal and unopinionated. You need to wire up:

- Configuration loading
- Database connections
- Validation
- Error handling patterns
- OpenAPI generation
- Logging setup
- CORS
- Project structure

**dy-rs** gives you all of this out of the box, while still giving you access to the full power of Axum when you need it.
