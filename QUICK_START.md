# 🚀 dy-rs - Quick Start Guide

[中文文档](QUICK_START-zh.md)

## ⏱️ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Download & Extract
You have the `dy-rs` folder with everything ready!

### Step 2: Initialize Git Repository
```bash
cd dy-rs
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - dy-rs v0.1.0"
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Go to https://github.com/new
# Create repository: dy-rs
# Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

git remote add origin https://github.com/gemiman/dy-rs.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Test Everything Works
```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the example
cd examples/rest-api
cargo run
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000/docs

### Step 5: Publish to crates.io (Optional - when ready)
```bash
# Login to crates.io
cargo login <your-api-token>

# Publish the core library
cd dy-rs
cargo publish

# Publish the CLI tool
cd ../dy-rs-cli
cargo publish
```

## 🐛 Known Limitations (Be Honest!)

This is MVP v0.1.0. Here's what's NOT included yet:
- Database migrations management (use sqlx directly for now)
- Auth/Authorization (coming in Phase 2)
- Comprehensive testing utilities
- GraphQL/gRPC templates
- Background jobs

**Be upfront about this in posts!** Early adopters appreciate honesty.

## 💬 How to Respond to Common Questions

### "Why not just use Axum?"
> "Great question! Axum is excellent (dy-rs is built on it). The difference is Axum is intentionally minimal - you still wire up config, validation, docs, etc. dy-rs adds the conventions for common use cases, like FastAPI extends Starlette. You can still use Axum patterns when needed!"

### "Is this production ready?"
> "Phase 1 MVP is functional and ready for early adopters. I'd recommend starting with non-critical services and contributing back issues. Core is solid (built on Axum, sqlx, tower), but the framework is new. Phase 2 (auth, migrations) coming soon for critical systems."

### "How is this different from Rocket/Actix?"
> "All great frameworks! Key differences: 1) Zero-config by default 2) Auto OpenAPI generation 3) Built-in validation with ValidatedJson 4) Opinionated project structure 5) CLI scaffolding. Think of it as more batteries-included."
